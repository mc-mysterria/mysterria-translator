# MysterriaTranslator - Custom Translation Prompts
# ==============================================
#
# This file allows you to customize the prompts sent to translation AI models.
# You can modify these prompts to improve translation quality or adapt to specific needs.
#
# Available template variables:
#   {sourceLang}     - Source language (e.g., "English", "Ukrainian")
#   {targetLang}     - Target language
#   {message}        - The text to be translated
#   {playerContext}  - List of online player names (Gemini only, when includeContext is enabled)
#
# Notes:
#   - LibreTranslate does not use custom prompts (it's a traditional translation API)
#   - OpenAI uses a separate system prompt and user prompt
#   - Gemini uses system instructions and a translation prompt
#   - Changes require /lang reload to take effect
